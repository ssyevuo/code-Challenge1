# Week 1: Toy Problems
This is a repository on the week 1 code challenge which is all focusing on JavaScript. To solve the problem we will use the concepts that have been taught durinng the week. The three challenges are the calculation of the students grade, speed detection, and net salary calculator.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator(Toy Problem)
Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.


For this program the user is prompted to input marks, the program evaluates the inputs and returns the corresponding grade based on the restrictions given and outputs an error message for any value that does not fall in the restrictions.

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector
Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. 
->If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. 
->For every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
-> If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: `License suspended`.

### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

For this program it takes the basic salary and benefits as input
The deductions are the **PAYE tax**, **NHIF**,**NSSF**, **gross Salary**, and **net salary**

### Encountered problems
The prompt function does not run in the VS code hence made use of JSFiddle to run the codes and ensure their functionality.
